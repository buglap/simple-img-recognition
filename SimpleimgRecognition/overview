Build an non powerfull image recognition model (10 diferents categories

-(cifar-10) dependencies: the images for train our model
C:\Program Files\Python36\Lib\site-packages\tensorflow\python\keras\datasets
or can get it here: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

for get the images get net cifar10.py that if it is it in your keras\datasets
you can find it here https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.12/tensorflow/python/keras/datasets/cifar10.py


    tf.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()
    Defined in tensorflow/python/keras/datasets/cifar10.py.
    Loads CIFAR10 dataset.

    Returns:
    Tuple of Numpy arrays: (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test).
